# MiddleGround Team Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Minimal phone use during SCRUM meetings

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The SCRUM Master is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

The team as a whole have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the SCRUM Master cody-giroux@uri.edu.

## Decisions

Majority based decision making with ample time to discuss features and or changes. Should not take more than a day to decide on how to proceed.

## Attendance

Meet at least once a week within class, unacceptable to miss an entire week without prior notice or any clear communicaiation in our social channels. 

## Assignments

Tasks will be posted on the Project Board and will be assigned at a first come first serve basis. PULL YOUR WEIGHT!! If you are having difficulty completing a picked up task, consult the group on how to proceed or ask to pass it off to another. Failure to provide substance to the project will result in conversation directly between the affiliated team member and the product owner

## Participation

Talk and communicate through discord, attempt  meetings over call. Does not have to be weekly but should be within the week, say one Sunday and then the Wednesday after the next week (10 days). Be doing tasks that are posted and don't let them linger, you should always have one task in progress

## Promptness

Similar to assignments, failure to comply will result in a requested conversation with the product owner.

## Conversational Courtesies

Be respectful to other team members and product owner. Listen when others are talking and take all ideas into consideration. Be a good sport and team player with participation. Even when having disagreements, you must respect the other team members. Create a community where everyone feels valued and free to express themselves.
